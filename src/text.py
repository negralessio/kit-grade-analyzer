            # Unofficial KIT Grade Analyzer

            - Simply select one or more cohorts from the multiselect widget and click on analyze.
            - The cohort names are scraped from the official ECTS Ranking Table that can be found here: 
            `https://www.sle.kit.edu/nachstudium/ects-einstufungstabellen.php`
            - Only works with the newer version of the documents starting WS22/23 (i.e. the ones
            with the cumulative column)
            - ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: As this is an non-official hobby project and not related to the KIT, please try to
            be responsible. Do not batter the KIT's web services too often. And remember the quote 
            *"Comparison is the thief of joy"* by Teddy Roosevelt. Otherwise, enjoy the analysis! :)
